# Recession-Analysis-LSTM

Economic Recession Prediction using LSTM
This repository contains a time series analysis to predict economic recessions based on key economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rate, and inflation using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

Dataset
The dataset (economic_data.csv) is a synthetic dataset generated with the following columns:

GDP: Gross Domestic Product (in % growth).
Unemployment: Unemployment rate (in %).
Inflation: Inflation rate (in %).
Recession: A binary label indicating whether a recession is present (1 for recession, 0 for no recession).
